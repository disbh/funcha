introduction: Each grain of basmati rice, kissed by saffron's golden hue, beckons the eager palate. Succulent pieces of tender chicken, marinated to perfection, nestle amidst the tapestry of flavors, their juices melding with the rice to create a symphony of taste. With each delicate bite, a burst of complexity ensues—cumin and coriander impart earthy undertones, while cloves and cardamom weave a subtle warmth. The heat of green chili and the tang of lemon elevate the dish, creating a harmonious balance that ignites the taste buds.

## Ingredients

### Chicken Marination Process:

- Place all chicken into large bowl
- Add 150 g yogurt, 1 1/2 tsp of Red Chili Powder, 1 tsp Salt, 4 tsp Ginger Juice
- Mix well, incorporation everything
- 2 teaspoons Biryani masala powder Refrigerate for 2+ hours; for best results, marinate overnight

### Tomato Puree Process:

- Cut 750 g of Tomatoes into quarters and boil with little water
- 1 1/2 Garlic paste, Salt, Sugar



## Preparation of Chicken

1. Heat 4 tbsp vegetable oil and fry 2 sliced onions once oil is heated.
2. Once onions begin to appear transparent, add 1 tsp Garlic Paste.
3. Fry the garlic with the onion slices until the raw smell of garlic dissapates. Begin to incorporate chicken pieces.
4. Cook for 10-12 minutes. When the color of the chicken begins to transform to a darker color, incorporate the Green Chilies, and salt.
5. The yogurt will eventually release oil. Add 1 cup of Tomate Puree.
6. Add salt to taste. Keep in mind salt has already been added in the chicken marination and when pureeing the tomatoes.
7. Cook for another 10-12 minutes, or until the smell of tomato puree has dissipated. 
8. As the cooking process comes to a close, add butter and coriander leaves.
8. Serve warm with breading such as roti or paratha.
